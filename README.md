## Project structure

**App**

**Actions**

Abstraction layer for the ui to use the services, form actions, links etc

```txt
/app
  /invoices
    actions.ts        ‚Üê local to the invoices feature
  /users
    actions.ts
```

**lib**

`db/`: raw queries or ORM
`services/`: business computation or derived logic
`types/`: TypeScript or Zod types
